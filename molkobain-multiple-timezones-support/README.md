## Description
Allow users to see or edit dates & times in their own timezone instead of the server's default one. Perfect for:

  * Companies with employees or customers accross several countries
  * Planning changes safely with everyone seeing the right time (no more math!)

### User setup
Easy on the users with a simple wizard to set up their timezone, they can either choose to let the app find their timezone and adjust it when they travel...

... or they can choose a specific timezone and stick to it (useful when working with a remote team) ...

... and, that's all! Timezone can be changed at any time in the user preferences.

### How it looks
Any dates & times attributes in the UI will automatically be converted, a small icon indicates that it is now displayed in the user's timezone. (see [limitations](#limitations)). Works in both the backoffice and the end-users portal.

## Limitations
**IMPORTANT: Before buying it, make sure you have read the following limitations.**

For the moment some parts of the application are NOT compatible with the timezones:

  * Notifications
  * Imports / exports
  * REST/JSON API
  * SLA computations are made based on the iTop server timezone, but on the user‚Äôs
  * End-user portal log entries can't be converted if date/time format is not the default one due to lack of metadata
  * **[iTop 2.7.x]** Backoffice log entries can‚Äôt be converted due to lack of metadata
  * **[iTop 2.7.x]** Tables that are automatically refreshed
