## Description
Display a tooltip on object's attributes (console only). AÂ ?Â is added next to the attribute's label to indicate that a description is available for an attribute.

Works with all objects (standard / from extensions / custom made), but only attributes for which a description exists will be affected.

Can be set on any field, to provide a long description to explain the usage of a particular field. This description can be more explicit to explain the meaning and expected usage of the field.

Description comes from iTop's dictionary entry ``'Class:<CLASS_NAME>/Attribute:<ATTRIBUTE_CODE>+' => 'Some description about the attribute'``.

As part of the standard datamodel, only few fields have such description documented, especially because it is specific to the way an organization uses iTop. But with this extension, it's a good opportunity to enrich your dictionnary with business tooltips for online guidance to your users.

*Note: By default iTop has not much descriptions, if you want to add some, you have to add dictionary entries.*
