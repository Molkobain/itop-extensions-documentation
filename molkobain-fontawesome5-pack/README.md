## How to
### Portal: Change a brick's icon
Let's say that for example you would like to change the *New request* icon with [this one](https://fontawesome.com/icons/book-open?style=solid). Just alter the portal XML to change the ``/itop_design/module_designs/module_design[@id="<PORTAL_ID>"]/bricks/brick[@id="services"]/decoration_class/default`` tag value with *fas fa-book-open fa-2x*

*XML before*

*XML after*

Run iTop setup and your portal home page should look like this!

*Result*
